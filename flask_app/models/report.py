# Class method vs Static Method
# The difference between the Class method and the static method is:

# A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
# A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
# In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
# We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
# When to use the class or static method?
# We generally use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
# We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
